# The Abandoned House

When she woke, she had no idea what a crazy day it would be. She grabbed breakfast and went to feed her pet lion. When she arrived at the lion's cage, she noticed it was empty! 

She ran around to the back of the house to find that the lion was about to jump
into a ballpit filled not with balls, but with chicken nuggets.
